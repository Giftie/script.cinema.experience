            - starting in this method stops the movie library from jumping to the next item(making a better flow)
- add       - new service script
            - allows for pause and resume to function off of xbmc.Player instance(keeps Home Automation scripting fast) - there are still times pause and resume fail to trigger though
            - allows the script to 'override' the default play action when selecting a video in the Movie Library.
                - What happens is the the script will see that XBMC has added something to the video playlist then stops the player(about 250ms delay)
                  You may see the Full Screen video show up for a split second(or longer) but the video should not play, then the script will take over.
                - Need to adjust the new setting in Miscellaneous( 'Override Play button' )
                - May not work for every one
                - also requires a restart of XBMC

                            HTTP API -> RunScript(script.cinema.experience,command<li>sqlquery<li>SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview WHERE c14 LIKE '%%action%%' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 10)

                            5 Random Movies from the Genre Comedy
                                SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview WHERE c14 LIKE '%%comedy%%' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5
                            
                            5 Random Movies Based on actor Adam Sandler:
                                SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview JOIN actorlinkmovie ON actorlinkmovie.idMovie=movieview.idMovie JOIN actors ON actorlinkmovie.idActor=actors.idActor WHERE strActor="Adam Sandler" ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5
